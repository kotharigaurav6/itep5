Command Line Interface (CLI)
---------------------------------------------------

CLI (Command-line interface) is the most common way to run a program in a terminal. As a software engineer, you’ll come across different CLIs every day namely git, Docker & npm etc.

Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI).

However, CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface.

Today, users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions. However some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line.

Compared with a graphical user interface, a command line interface requires fewer system resources to implement.
The command line provides an interface between programs as well as the user.
