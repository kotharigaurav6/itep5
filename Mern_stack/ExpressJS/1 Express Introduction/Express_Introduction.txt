What is Express.js?
------------------------------
1) Express.js is a web application framework that is built on top of Node.js. or (Express is an application level framework of nodeJs.Used to generate efficient web application,web services,& to overcome the drawbacks of nodeJS implementations)

2) Express.js adds flexibility to an application with a huge range of modules available on npm that you can directly plug into Express as per requirement.

3) It was developed by TJ Holo-way-chuk and was released in the market on 22nd of May, 2010.

4) Formerly it was managed by IBM but currently, it is placed under the stewardship of the Node.js Foundation incubator.
 
5)Express is majorly responsible for handling the backend part in the MEAN/MERN stack. 
MEAN/MERN Stack is the open-source JavaScript software stack that is heavily used for building dynamic websites and web applications in the market. Here, MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js.

(express is dependency i.e module)

As we know, Node is javascript runtime environment and Express is a web application framework.(we can directly rander html view in express but not in node.)

Drawbacks of nodeJs
------------------------------------
1) Mannual routing checking
    if(request.url=='/login'){ }

2) Manual Method checking
    if(request.method=='POST' && request.url=='/register'){}

3) Problem in static file routing like style.css | images (needs to write code explicitly for request)

4) No view randering support, here we directly cannot rander view, first we add it in response then perform 
operations on it.

5) No template engine support.

6) code complexity due to no default architecture.(fetching data and connectivity on the same page).

7) Response Management
    --> to manage response header for each type of data
    --> in response, data will always be send   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ note ]
1) we can represent both client side and server side code on template engine.
2) Middleware is the back bone of express framework. All the problems of node is solved by middleware.

Features of Express.js
-------------------------------------
1) Express quickens the development pace of a web application.
2) It also helps in creating mobile and web application of single-page, multi-page, and hybrid types
3) Express can work with various templating engines such as Pug, Mustache, and EJS.
    For Ex : if we talk about ejs, then .ejs extension pages are considered as template pages, and they loads easily,
    whereas html pages or javascript pages not loads.
    (Browser screen par dikhega html type page he, jo internally convert hua he .)

Prerequisite for PUG is pug script, then only we can use.
EJS --> pure html code

4) Express follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
        M = Model       = models   =DB implementations (Mongoose | mongodb)
        V = View           = views      = UI of an application  ( EJS )
        C = Controller = routes    = Application business Logic ( express )
        (Routes and views already bane banae mil jate he, we need to create model)

5) It makes the integration process with databases such as MongoDB, Redis, MySQL effortless.
6) Express also defines an error-handling middleware.
7) Built-In URL routing  and method checking.
8) Support for middleware(middleware are Intermediators)
        a) Application-level middleware
        b) Router-level middleware
        c) Error-handling middleware
        d) Built-in middleware
        e) Third-party middleware
